My PHP Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The website is dynamic and database-driven, and users can log in to explore my work.

Key Features & Tech Stack:

PHP & MySQL: Fetches and displays data from multiple databases and tables.
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript: Responsive and modern front-end.
Database: MySQL / MariaDB (fetching data from multiple databases and tables)
